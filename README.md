# Node-Js-Server
- Created a Node.Js Server using Express.Js Framework and added routing to various tabs like : /users,/user/:id and associated the HTTP methods like GET, POST, PATCH 
  and DELETE to add some functionalities for Getting, Creating, Modifying and Deleting user's Data in the MOCK_DATA.json folder using POSTMAN services on the server.
- Used Middle-Ware Functions to check the existing entires and also to check if all the required fields of a user are entered by the client.
- Also, added a custom HTTP header in the response object named as: "X-devName" - "Sameer Malek".
- Associated the HTTP status codes accordingly for each response to teh user for example codes such as: 200,201,400,404 for different responses.
